= Chuck Norris Jenkins Plugin

This plugin adds an absolutely delightful feature to Jenkins:
depending if your build succeeds, fails, or is unstable, it will show
a picture of Chuck Norris *auto-adapting* (that's right, computer science it is!) to the build result!

Seeing that, already many thousands (yes, *thousands*!) of people have decided to take the
plunge and install this plugin to finally see the light. Why not you?
